# LearnBot Simulation Protocol

The LearnBot Simulation Protocol aims to standardize the communication between the [Logical Simulator](#logical-simulator) ([PiCode](https://picode.com.br) side) and the [Physical Simulator](#physical-simulator) ([Oorbit](https://oorbit.com.br) side) during the LearnBot simulation.

## Logical Simulator

The [Logical Simulator](#logical-simulator) mimics the LearnBot behaviour by interpreting the code generated by the user (after being transpiled) and sending [state messages](#state-message) to the [Physical Simulator](#physical-simulator) so it can show its effects to the user.

## Physical Simulator

The [Physical Simulator](#physical-simulator) simulates the physical LearnBot board wich may have external components attached to it. It also interacts with users by giving them an way to setup the physical environment and interact with its sensors. When any changes that may affect the simulation state happen, an [event message](#event-message) must be sent to the [Logical Simulator](#logical-simulator).

## State

The simulation state is managed by the [Logical Simulator](#logical-simulator) and upon changes an [state message](#state-message) is sent to the [Physical Simulator](#physical-simulator).

### State Message

The [state message](#state-message) contains information about the current simulation state. For simplicity, the message (see below) is represented in the YAML format. However, the actual implementation is a JavaScript Object.

```yaml
simulation:
  type: LearnBot v1.2
  status: running # running, paused or stopped
  loading: 0.951 # (95.1%) 0 to 1

data:
  components:
    builtin:
      inputs:
        temperature: 0.253 # 0 to 1
        ldr: 0.485 # 0 to 1
        button_0: 0 # 0 or 1 (B0)
        button_1: 1 # 0 or 1 (B1)
        button_2: 1 # 0 or 1 (B2)
        button_3: 0 # 0 or 1 (B3)
        button_4: 1 # 0 or 1 (BT2)

      outputs:
        buzzer: 0.000 # 0 to 1 (0 to 20KHz)
        led_0: 0.521 # 0 to 1  (pin 9)
        led_1: 0.200 # 0 to 1 (pin 10)
        led_2: 0.076 # 0 to 1 (pin 11)
        led_3: 1 # 0 or 1 (pin 12)
        led_4: 0 # 0 or 1 (pin 13)
        led_rgb: [0.021, 0.795, 0.003] # R, G and B are numeric values ranging from 0 to 1
        led_power: 1 # 0 or 1

    external:
      inputs:
        ultrasonic:
          value: 0.474 # 0 to 1
          trigger_pin: 7 # 7 or 8
          echo_pin: 8 # 7 or 8

      outputs:
        servo_motor_0:
          value: 0.998 # 0 to 1
          signal_pin: 3 # 3 or 11

        servo_motor_1:
          value: 0.212 # 0 to 1
          signal_pin: 11 # 3 or 11

        dc_motor_0: # MA
          speed: 0.671 # 0 to 1 (pin 5)
          direction: 0 # 0 or 1 (clockwise or counter-clockwise)
          positive_pin: 9 # 9 or 10
          negative_pin: 10 # 9 or 10

        dc_motor_1: # MB
          speed: 1.000 # 0 to 1 (pin 6)
          direction: 1 # 0 or 1 (clockwise or counter-clockwise respectively)
          positive_pin: 12 # 4 or 12
          negative_pin: 4 # 4 or 12
```

### Simulation status

The [simulation status](#simulation-status) could be one of the following:

- `running` - The simulation is being executed
- `paused` - Freezes the simulation but keeps its values
- `stopped` - Restart the simulation to the initial values and waits until it's running again

### Initial Values

For input and output fields, the initial value is 0. For component pins the initial value is -1 (disconnected).

The simulation starts at the **stopped** state with the loading progress set to 0.

## Events

Events are managed by the [Physical Simulator](#physical-simulator) and upon changes a message in the [state message](#state-message) or [event message](#event-message) format is sent to the [Logical Simulator](#logical-simulator).

### Event Message

The [event message](#event-message) contains information about simulation state properties that has been changed. For simplicity, the message (see below) is represented in the YAML format. However, the actual implementation is a JavaScript Object.

```yaml
# optional
simulation:
  type: LearnBot v1.2
  status: running # running, paused or stopped
  loading: 0.951 # (95.1%) 0 to 1

# optional
data:
  components:
    - name: button_1
      type: builtin
      value: 0 # 0 or 1

    - name: servor_motor_0
      type: external
      signal_pin: 3 # 3 or 11

    - name: ultrasonic
      type: external
      value: 0.474 # 0 to 1
      trigger_pin: 7 # 7 or 8
      echo_pin: 8 # 7 or 8
```
